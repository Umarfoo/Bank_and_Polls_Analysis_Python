# Python - Bank and Polls Analysis


# Task Details

In this assignment, we were given two data sets for analysis and printing out the outcome in the terminal as well as exporting a txt file. 

We had to apply our concepts learnt in class to run analysis of PyBank and PyPoll file. Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where our newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. 

# PyBank
In this task, we were provided the data of a firms monthly income for 86 months and we had to analyis the following details using python code: 

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

After running the python code following outcomes were acheived: [PyBank Results](PyBank/images/results.png)

# PyPoll

In this challenge, we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

We were given a set of poll data in CSV format containing more then 3 Million rows. The dataset was composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. We were tasked to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

After running the python code following outcomes were acheived: [PyPoll Results](PyPoll/images/results.png)
